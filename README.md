HTML/CSS Project from The Odin Project.

GOAL: Re-Create the Google Homepage.

This README serves to document progress and challenges encountered during the project.

//1) I realize I have been using the dev tools on the actual Google Homepage too much on and cut my learning experience short. Focus will be placed on reading documentation and searching the web for solutions. Dev tools will be limited to debug my own site for now.

//2) Finally finished the project within the scope of odin project. It is not pixel perfect but I am happy with the result.
